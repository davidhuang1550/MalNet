In the same year, 2 billion devices were running Android with estimated infection rates of 0.31% per month. This results in a staggering 6 million Android device infections each month!"

Cybercriminals frequently take advantage of this to evade signature-based detection, which is the predominant form of malware detection."

While hash-based techniques are vulnerable to the polymorphic nature of malware, graph and image-based representations have been shown to be much more robust. Our goal is to support the research community by providing a standardized dataset to benchmark new malware detection techniques."
